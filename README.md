What are the current and future use of AI for safety in the aviation industry?

Air crashes are almost always fatal; one is more likely to survive any other transportation accident than an air crash. Therefore, the aviation industry is highly monitored and regulated to maintain the highest standards of safety at all times. Human error has been identified to be the sequence initiating cause in more than 40 percent of aircraft accidents while equipment failure was found to be the cause in about 23 percent of the accidents. AI has immense potential to make the future of the aviation industry bigger as well as safer.
